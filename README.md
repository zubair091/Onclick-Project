# Onclick-Project
Onclick When the user clicks a designated element, such as a button, this event triggers a function to display the current time and the vertical scroll position of the document. This information is then shown on the user's interface, providing real-time updates on both the time and the document's position.https://github.com/zubair091/Onclick-Project/
